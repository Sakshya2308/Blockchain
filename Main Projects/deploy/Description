Deployed contract in which a number is stored using GANACHE v2.5.4 as RPC private key provider.
Further made a prototype by creating app on alchemy and using the HTTPS of the app as RPC provider and Private key of metamask wallet. The testnet used was goerli.
Improved the security by encrypting the Private key by creating an additional encryptKey.js file linking with .env file where initially tha PRIVATE_KEY and PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD was stored which was later removed.
Used .gitignore to ignore the .env, node_modules and encryptedKey.json.
Created an additional .prettierrc file so that other developers can use the same format used in the project.

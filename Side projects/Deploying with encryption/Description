Secured private key and password through .env file and encrypted it.

1. Inside .env file we created the PRIVATE_KEY and a PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD variable.
2. To make sure that the private key is safe we encrypted it by creating encryptKey.js.
3. By executing encryptKey.js a json file was created which was linked to .env file, so we removed PRIVATE_KEY and PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD variable from .env file.

Now none of the files have private key and private key password (It is
encrypted). So even if the hacker has excess to our encryptKey.js or encryptedKey.json, it is protected by password.
